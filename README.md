# About the Project
This repository is created to introduce and demonstrate the use of various data visualization tools. It contains visualizations made using popular Python libraries such as Plotly, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Altair, Numpy, Pandas, Plotnine, and Vega Datasets.

# Used Libraries
* Altair (v5.2.0): A declarative visualization library for creating simple yet effective visualizations.
* Matplotlib (v3.8.0): One of Python's most popular visualization libraries. Capable of creating various types of graphs like line charts, bar charts, histograms, etc.
* Numpy (v1.23.4): A fundamental library for scientific computing. A powerful tool for data manipulation and analysis.
* Pandas (v2.1.3): Used for data analysis and manipulation. Essential for processing, analyzing, and visualizing datasets.
* Plotly (v5.18.0): A library that allows the creation of interactive and high-quality visualizations.
* Plotnine (v0.12.4): Python version of R's ggplot2, offering a grammar-based approach to data visualization.
* Seaborn (v0.13.0): A Matplotlib-based library that provides advanced visualization tools, particularly for statistical graphics.
* Vega Datasets (v0.9.0): Offers sample datasets for Vega and Vega-Lite, useful for data visualization examples.
